## Snake Water Gun Game Using Python:-
Welcome to the **Snake-Water-Gun Game** repository! This is a fun and interactive command-line game implemented in Python. The game is based on the classic hand-gesture game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each choice has a unique interaction with the others.

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using python.

The **Snake-Water-Gun Game** is a simple Python project that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and random number generation. The goal is to provide a fun way to learn Python while enjoying a classic game.

This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.

## Following are the rules of the game:
1- Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.

2- Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water

3- Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

## Random module:
The random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables. It can be used perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, selecting a random elements from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc.

We will use random.choice() method and nested if-else statements to select a random item from a list.
